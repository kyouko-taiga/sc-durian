## sc-durian

This project is only meant as a small-scale experiment to play with Scala's support for generic programming.

### Usage

This is a normal sbt project. You can compile code with `sbt compile`, run it with `sbt run`, and `sbt console` will start a Scala 3 REPL.

Use `sbt assembly` to produce a jar.
Then you can run it with `java -jar target/scala-3.3.1/sc-durian.jar`

For more information on the sbt-dotty plugin, see the
[scala3-example-project](https://github.com/scala/scala3-example-project/blob/main/README.md).
